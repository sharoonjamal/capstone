Assisting fashion enthusiasts in streamlining their shopping experience. This application focuses primarily on the backend logic and services, ensuring a seamless interface for the frontend.

Phase 1

    The foundational step of this project is ensuring that customers can seamlessly browse through the available clothing items and make purchases. Each shopping session retains the cart items for 30 minutes.

Phase 2

    Customers can either:
        Browse through various clothing categories, view available stock and see related items.
        Select a specific clothing item and view similar items or those that complement their selection. The items should be ordered by popularity or rating. We prioritize a smooth customer journey, or as Aaron fondly refers to it, "The fashion-forward logic"!

Phase 3

    As the shop owner, gain insights into metrics about popular clothing items, frequent shoppers, and sales trends.
    As a customer:
        Modify, update, or cancel orders.
        Receive notifications about upcoming sales or stock updates.
        Set recurring orders for items they buy frequently, e.g., every month.
        Join a waitlist for out-of-stock items and get notified when they're available.

Additional Features

    Shop customization: Shop owners can personalize their storefronts.
    Product listings are handled on the backend, but integration with dynamic frontend UI is in progress.
    Customers receive confirmation emails after successful transactions.
